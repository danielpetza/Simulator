# Simulator
The Simulator is a comprehensive simulation platform for activity recognition and behavioral modeling within smart home environments.
It reproduces user interactions with domestic objects and environmental sensors, enabling a context-aware understanding of daily activities and the generation of alternative behavioral scenarios.

The simulated activities exhibit realistic temporal and contextual patterns, closely reflecting real-world behaviors and providing a reliable basis for training and testing classification algorithms for human activity recognition and behavior analysis.
